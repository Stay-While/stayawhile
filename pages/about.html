    Stay@while is a service where the parking ticketing system for residential areas becomes fully electronic. 
    Instead of going to payment terminals and putting in information, all the necessary parking information will be online. 
    The paper trail is diminished, and tickets/permits become easily accessible to the customer and even parking patrol in the area. 
    If an expired ticket is detected, there will also be a way to see which towing company was contacted, 
    so the customer can go directly to the source instead of taking all the different routes of reaching more than one towing company in the area to find their car.
    Residential owners will have the ability to add their parking lots and prices to our system for the clients. The system will make parking payments fully digital.
    Therefore, landlords do not need to worry about their transaction system.
