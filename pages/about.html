          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px"> Stay@while</span> is a service where the parking ticketing
          system for residential areas becomes fully electronic. Instead of going to payment terminals and putting in
          information, all the necessary parking information will be online. The paper trail is diminished, and
          tickets/permits become easily accessible to the customer and even parking patrol in the area. If an expired
          ticket is detected, there will also be a way to see which towing company was contacted, so the customer can go
          directly to the source instead of taking all the different routes of reaching more than one towing company in
          the area to find their car. Residential owners will have the ability to add their parking lots and prices to
          our system for the clients. The system will make parking payments fully digital. Therefore, landlords do not
          need to worry about their transaction system.
